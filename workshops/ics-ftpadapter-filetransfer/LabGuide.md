![](images/200/Picture-lab.png)

Updated: 09-Mar-2018

## Introduction

This sample demonstrates how to read an opaque file from a "/" directory and write the file to an "/upload" directory in a scheduled orchestrated integration. An FTP Adapter reads the file from the / directory and another FTP Adapter writes the file to the /upload directory. An assign action is configured to assign variables for the file name and file size. A logging message is created to indicate that the file name has been read. The message is logged to the activity stream for viewing. You also track the integration and monitor message status.

### **STEP 1**: Review Agile Board

- This Lab assumes that you just completed Lab 100 and are still connected to the Oracle Cloud, that you're still in the Developer cloud Service Dashboard, and you're viewing the "Alpha Office Product Catalog Project". If for some reason that is not the case, follow the first several Steps of Lab 100 to once again view the Developer Cloud Service Console.
