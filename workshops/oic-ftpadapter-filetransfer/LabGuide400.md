## Introduction

This is the fourth several labs that are part of the **CSH Campaign Assets 2018: File Transfer with Oracle Integration Cloud**. This workshop will demonstrate how to read an opaque file from a *inbound* directory and write the file to an *upload* directory in a scheduled orchestrated integration. 

In this lab, you will learn how to test a basic File Transfer integration using a scheduled orchestration.
