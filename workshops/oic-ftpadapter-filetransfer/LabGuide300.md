Updated: 11-Mar-2018

## Introduction

This is the third of several labs that are part of the **CSH Campaign Assets 2018: File Transfer with Oracle Integration Cloud**. This workshop will demonstrate how to read an opaque file from a *inbound* directory and write the file to an *upload* directory in a scheduled orchestrated integration. 

In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic File Transfer integration, using a scheduled orchestration. This integration will use the FTP connection creation in the previous lab (200).

## Objectives

- Create your first integration to transfer a file from an inbound to an outbound folder.

# Create a New Integration
Connections allow Integration Cloud to interact with an application instance. A connection is required for every application instance that participates in an integration. In this lab, you will create one connection - for an FTP folder using the FTP adapter. 

## Create the Integration

### **STEP 1**: 


## Configure the FTP Connection (ReadFile & WriteFile)



## Create a Logging Message


## Configure an Assign action


## Map the data


## Track Fields


## Activate the Integration
