Updated: 11-Mar-2018

## Introduction

This is the third of several labs that are part of the **CSH Campaign Assets 2018: File Transfer with Oracle Integration Cloud**. This workshop will demonstrate how to read an opaque file from a *inbound* directory and write the file to an *upload* directory in a scheduled orchestrated integration. 

In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic File Transfer integration, using a scheduled orchestration. This integration will use the FTP connection creation in the previous lab (200).

## Objectives

- Create your first integration to transfer a file from an inbound to an outbound folder.

## Required Artifacts

-   The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

# Create a New Integration
Connections allow Integration Cloud to interact with an application instance. A connection is required for every application instance that participates in an integration. In this lab, you will create one connection - for an FTP folder using the FTP adapter. 

## Create the Integration

### **STEP 1**:  Create a scheduled orchestrated integration

- Start **Integration Cloud** and click on **Integrations**.

- Fill in the **Create New Integration** form with the following information:

  **What triggers this integration?**: `Schedule`	

  **What do you want to call your integration?**: `FileTransfer_XX` (where `XX` should be your initials)

  **Identifier**: Auto generated (keep default value)

  **What does this integration do?**: `This is a File Transfer integration to read an opaque file from an inbound directory and write the file to an upload directory.`

  Click **Create** to initialize and open the integration.

## Configure the FTP Connection (ReadFile & WriteFile)

Let's start with the **ReadFile** operation.

- In the **Invokes** panel, expand the **FTP** heading, and find your connection, under **FTPConnection_XX**

- In the **Basic Info** page, enter `ReadFile` for endpoint name and click **Next**.
  
- In the **Operations** page, enter the following information and click **Next**.
  
  **Select Operation**: `Read a File`
  
  **Select a Transfer Mode**: `Binary`

  **Input Directory**: `/`

  **File Name**: `1KB.zip`

- In the **Schema** page, enter the following information and click **Next**.
