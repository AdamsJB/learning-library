## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **CSH Campaign Assets 2018: File Transfer with Oracle Integration Cloud**. This workshop will demonstrate how to read an opaque file from a *inbound* directory and write the file to an *upload* directory in a scheduled orchestrated integration. 

In the first lab (100), we focused on provisioning the Oracle Integration Cloud environment become familiar with it's service console and functionality.. In this lab you will create the connection which allows Integration Cloud to interact with and FTP server.

## Objectives

- Configure the connection properties 
- Test the connection

# Create Connection
Connections allow Integration Cloud to interact with an application instance. A connection is required for every application instance that participates in an integration. In this lab, you will create one connection - for an FTP folder using the FTP adapter. 

## Create the FTP Connection

### **STEP 1**: Configure the connection properties

- Start **Integration Cloud** and click on **Integrations**.

- In the resulting **Designer** navigation pane, click **Connections**.

- Fill in the **Create New Connection**  form with the following connection information.

  - **Name**: `FTPConnection_XX` (where `XX` should be your initials)
  
  - **Identifier**: Auto generated (keep default value)
  
  - **Role**: Trigger and Invoke (keep default value)
  
  - **Description**:  `This is an FTP connection to public ftp server "speedtest.tele2.net" used by Oracle Samples.`
  
  - Click **Create** to complete the connection properties.
  
- In the **Email Address** field of the Connection Administrator section, enter your email address.

- Click **Configure Connectivity** to configure the FTP URL. Enter the following information in the **Connection Properties** dialog (only required fields are shown):

  - **FTP Server Host Address**: `speedtest.tele2.net`
  
  - **FTP Server Port**: `21` 
  
  - Click **OK**.
  
- Next, click **Configure Security** to configure the connection security settings. Enter the following information in the **Credentials** dialog (only required fields are shown):

  - **Security Policy**: `FTP Server Access Policy` (dafault value)
  
  - **User name**: `anonymous`
  
  - **Password**: `<choose any>` (the security level is low as it's a public FTP server)
  
  - Click **OK** to save settings. 
  
- You will notice the connection is not complete at this point. Proceed to the next step to finalize the connection.

### **STEP 2**: Test and complete the connection

- In the top right corner, Click **Test** to verify and complete the connection.
